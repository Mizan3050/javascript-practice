      // here function c will gets access to lexical environment of all its parent functions
      // c() -> a () -> global -> null
      // this is called scope chaining

      // let const and var
      // var and functions are hoisted and are available to access within the scope right after they are hosted, though the value will be available only after initialization
      // for let and const, hoisting works differently
      // let and const are are stored in a different memory space but they are in temporal dead zone

      // reference error
      // whenever we try to access a let or const before its initialization we get reference error
      // type error
      // If we try to reassign value to const we get type error
      // syntax error
      // not initializing const, redeclaration of let in same scope

      // BLOCk SCOPE
      // multiple javascript statements combined in a group enclosing within curly braces
      // what are variables and functions can be accessed in a block is known as block scope

      //   {
      //     var t = 10;
      //     let q = 5;
      //     {
      //         var d = 100;
      //     }
      //   }
      //   console.log(t)
      //   console.log(d)
      //   console.log(q)

      // functions create their own local scope
      // blocks create their block scope
